# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Overview
This project delves into the analysis of the Titanic dataset, one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. The aim is to use data science and machine learning to uncover patterns and predict survival outcomes of the passengers. This project employs Python and several key libraries in data science, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

## Dataset
The dataset is split into two files:
- `train.csv`: Contains passenger information and survival outcome (used for training the model).
- `test.csv`: Contains passenger information without survival outcomes (used for predictions).

## Features
The dataset includes several features:
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard (SibSp)
- Number of Parents/Children Aboard (Parch)
- Ticket Number
- Passenger Fare
- Cabin Number
- Port of Embarkation

## Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: Importing the datasets using Pandas.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature engineering, and scaling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing various features and their impact on survival using visualization tools.
4. **Model Training**: Implementing a Random Forest Classifier to predict survival outcomes.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
6. **Prediction on Test Data**: Applying the trained model to the test dataset to predict survival outcomes.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
